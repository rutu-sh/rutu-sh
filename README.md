## Bootstrapping with Kubernetes

I'm writing a book for those who want to start with Kubernetes and want to explore how the entire Kubernetes ecosystem functions with different tools. This is also an effort to help others appreciate the elegance of Kubernetes. The book is available [here](https://rutu-sh.github.io/bootstrapping-with-kubernetes/).

## OpenTelemetry and Kubernetes
Kubernetes and Opentelemetry are the two widely used CNCF projects. I'm doing some experiments with setting up Opentelemetry in a variety of configurations inside a Kubernetes cluster.
